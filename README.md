## Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Cybersecurity Insights

Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This collection houses documentation for Task 2 of my internship, focusing on performing image encryption and decryption using pixel manipulation by applying basic mathematical operations (such as XOR) to each pixel.

### Task Overview
Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel.
Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images.
